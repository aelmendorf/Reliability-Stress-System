Notes:
QbasicTimers in custom class tWrap work now, issue was the ID
in tWrap was being overwritten by me of course.  Way to much
time spent on that, need to work on this at home without
distractions

****need to write bash script for installing this software
and all needed libs.compiliers/etc


ToDo:
 Combine with old version.  with each tWrap having it's own
 timer issue of overflow is solved

tWrap;
 1:convert time, do not hold value in msec, keep it in mins and
    hours
 2:  overload << operators with line out put for files and tables

Controller:
1: add New,Continue functionality.  Write a function to
    read in from ini file wiht list of all running test
2: make pop windows which dsplay list and return to main window
    with user selection
3: add serial library you wrote from last version
4: add exceptions
5: more when i think of it


**HAVE THIS DONE OR AT LEAST FUNCTIONAL BY MONDAY**
